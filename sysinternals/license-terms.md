# Sysinternals Software License Terms

These license terms are an agreement between Sysinternals (a wholly

-   supplements,

-   and support services

for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so,
those terms apply.

state” information, files saved by Sysinternals tools may include
personally identifiable or other sensitive information (such as

accessed). By using this software, you acknowledge that you are aware of
this and take sole responsibility for any personally identifiable or

regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions
on destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, see

## Support Services

Because this software is "as is," we may not provide support services
for it.

## Entire Agreement

This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based
services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for
the software and support services.

## Applicable Law

United States . If you acquired the software in the United States ,
Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and
applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws
principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other
claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair
competition laws, and in tort.

Outside the United States . If you acquired the software in any other
country, the laws of that country apply.

## Legal Effect

This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights
under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to
the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not
change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your
country do not permit it to do so.

## Disclaimer of Warranty

The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it.
Sysinternals gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You
may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this
agreement cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws,
sysinternals excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness
for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

## Limitation on and Exclusion of Remedies and Damages

You can recover from sysinternals and its suppliers only direct damages
up to U.S. \$5.00. You cannot recover any other damages, including
consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages.

This limitation applies to

-   anything related to the software, services, content (including code)
    on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
-   claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or
    condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent
    permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if Sysinternals knew or should have known about the
possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not
apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
