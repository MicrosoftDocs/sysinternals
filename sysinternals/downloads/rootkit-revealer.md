## Introduction

RootkitRevealer is an advanced rootkit detection utility. It runs on
Windows XP (32-bit) and Windows Server 2003 (32-bit), and its output
lists Registry and file system API discrepancies that may indicate the
presence of a user-mode or kernel-mode rootkit. RootkitRevealer
successfully detects many persistent rootkits including AFX, Vanquish
and HackerDefender (note: RootkitRevealer is not intended to detect
rootkits like Fu that don't attempt to hide their files or registry
keys). If you use it to identify the presence of a rootkit please let us
know!

The reason that there is no longer a command-line version is that
malware authors have started targeting RootkitRevealer's scan by using
its executable name. We've therefore updated RootkitRevealer to execute
its scan from a randomly named copy of itself that runs as a Windows
service. This type of execution is not conducive to a command-line
interface. Note that you can use command-line options to execute an
automatic scan with results logged to a file, which is the equivalent of
the command-line version's behavior.  

## What is a Rootkit?

The term rootkit is used to describe the mechanisms and techniques
whereby malware, including viruses, spyware, and trojans, attempt to
hide their presence from spyware blockers, antivirus, and system
management utilities. There are several rootkit classifications
depending on whether the malware survives reboot and whether it executes
in user mode or kernel mode.

**Persistent Rootkits**  
A persistent rootkit is one associated with malware that activates each
time the system boots. Because such malware contain code that must be
executed automatically each system start or when a user logs in, they
must store code in a persistent store, such as the Registry or file
system, and configure a method by which the code executes without user
intervention.

**Memory-Based Rootkits**  
Memory-based rootkits are malware that has no persistent code and
therefore does not survive a reboot.

**User-mode Rootkits**  
There are many methods by which rootkits attempt to evade detection. For
example, a user-mode rootkit might intercept all calls to the Windows
FindFirstFile/FindNextFile APIs, which are used by file system
exploration utilities, including Explorer and the command prompt, to
enumerate the contents of file system directories. When an application
performs a directory listing that would otherwise return results that
contain entries identifying the files associated with the rootkit, the
rootkit intercepts and modifies the output to remove the entries.

The Windows native API serves as the interface between user-mode clients
and kernel-mode services and more sophisticated user-mode rootkits
intercept file system, Registry, and process enumeration functions of
the Native API. This prevents their detection by scanners that compare
the results of a Windows API enumeration with that returned by a native
API enumeration.

**Kernel-mode Rootkits**  
Kernel-mode rootkits can be even more powerful since, not only can they
intercept the native API in kernel-mode, but they can also directly
manipulate kernel-mode data structures. A common technique for hiding
the presence of a malware process is to remove the process from the
kernel's list of active processes. Since process management APIs rely on
the contents of the list, the malware process will not display in
process management tools like Task Manager or Process Explorer.  

## How RootkitRevealer Works

Since persistent rootkits work by changing API results so that a system
view using APIs differs from the actual view in storage, RootkitRevealer
compares the results of a system scan at the highest level with that at
the lowest level. The highest level is the Windows API and the lowest
level is the raw contents of a file system volume or Registry hive (a
hive file is the Registry's on-disk storage format). Thus, rootkits,
whether user mode or kernel mode, that manipulate the Windows API or
native API to remove their presence from a directory listing, for
example, will be seen by RootkitRevealer as a discrepancy between the
information returned by the Windows API and that seen in the raw scan of
a FAT or NTFS volume's file system structures.

**Can a Rootkit hide from RootkitRevealer**  
It is theoretically possible for a rootkit to hide from RootkitRevealer.
Doing so would require intercepting RootkitRevealer's reads of Registry
hive data or file system data and changing the contents of the data such
that the rootkit's Registry data or files are not present. However, this
would require a level of sophistication not seen in rootkits to date.
Changes to the data would require both an intimate knowledge of the
NTFS, FAT and Registry hive formats, plus the ability to change data
structures such that they hide the rootkit, but do not cause
inconsistent or invalid structures or side-effect discrepancies that
would be flagged by RootkitRevealer.

**Is there a sure-fire way to know of a rootkit's presence**  
In general, not from within a running system. A kernel-mode rootkit can
control any aspect of a system's behavior so information returned by any
API, including the raw reads of Registry hive and file system data
performed by RootkitRevealer, can be compromised. While comparing an
on-line scan of a system and an off-line scan from a secure environment
such as a boot into a CD-based operating system installation is more
reliable, rootkits can target such tools to evade detection by even
them.

The bottom line is that there will never be a universal rootkit scanner,
but the most powerful scanners will be on-line/off-line comparison
scanners that integrate with antivirus.

## Using RootkitRevealer

RootkitRevealer requires that the account from which its run has
assigned to it the Backup files and directories, Load drivers and
Perform volume maintenance tasks (on Windows XP and higher) privileges.
The Administrators group is assigned these privileges by default. In
order to minimize false positives run RootkitRevealer on an idle system.

For best results exit all applications and keep the system otherwise
idle during the RootkitRevealer scanning process.

If you have questions or problems please visit the [Sysinternals
RootkitRevealer Forum](https://forum.sysinternals.com).  

## Manual Scanning

To scan a system launch it on the system and press the Scan button.
RootkitRevealer scans the system reporting its actions in a status area
at the bottom of its window and noting discrepancies in the output list.
The options you can configure:

- **Hide NTFS Metadata Files:** this option is on by default and has
    RootkitRevealer not show standard NTFS metadata files, which are
    hidden from the Windows API.
- **Scan Registry:** this option is on by default. Deselecting it has
    RootkitRevealer not perform a Registry scan.  

## Launching an Automatic Scan

RootkitRevealer supports several options for auto-scanning systems:

**Usage: rootkitrevealer \[-a \[-c\] \[-m\] \[-r\] outputfile\]**

|Parameter  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|  **-a**  |  Automatically scan and exit when done. |
|  **-c**  |  Format output as CSV. |
|  **-m**  |  Show NTFS metadata files. |
|  **-r**  | Don't scan the Registry. |

Note that the file output location must be on a local volume.

If you specify the -c option it does not report progress and
discrepancies are printed in CSV format for easy import into a database.
You can perform scans of remote systems by executing it with the
Sysinternals PsExec utility using a command-line like the following:

**psexec \\\\remote -c rootkitrevealer.exe -a
c:\\windows\\system32\\rootkit.log**  

## Interpreting the Output

This is a screenshot of RootkitRevealer detecting the presence of the
popular HackerDefender rootkit. The Registry key discrepancies show that the Registry keys
storing HackerDefender's device driver and service settings are not
visible to the Windows API, but are present in the raw scan of the
Registry hive data. Similarly, the HackerDefender-associated files are
not visible to Windows API directory scans, but are present in the scan
of the raw file system data.

You should examine all discrepancies and determine the likelihood that
they indicate the presence of a rootkit. Unfortunately, there is no
definitive way to determine, based on the output, if a rootkit is
present, but you should examine all reported discrepancies to ensure
that they are explainable. If you determine that you have a rootkit
installed, search the web for removal instructions. If you are unsure as
to how to remove a rootkit you should reformat the system's hard disk
and reinstall Windows.

In addition to the information below on possible RootkitRevealer
discrepancies, the RootkitRevealer Forum at Sysinternals discusses
detected rootkits and specific false-positives.  

**Hidden from Windows API**

These discrepancies are the ones exhibited by most rootkits; however, if
you haven't checked the Hide NTFS metadata files you should expect to
see a number of such entries on any NTFS volume, since NTFS hides its
metadata files, such as \$MFT and \$Secure, from the Windows API. The
metadata files present on NTFS volumes vary by version of NTFS and the
NTFS features that have been enabled on the volume. There are also
antivirus products, such as Kaspersky Antivirus, that use rootkit
techniques to hide data they store in NTFS alternate data streams. If
you are running such a virus scanner you'll see a Hidden from Windows
API discrepancy for an alternate data stream on every NTFS file.
RootkitRevealer does not support output filters because rootkits can
take advantage of any filtering. Finally, if a file is deleted during a
scan you may also see this discrepancy.

This is a list of NTFS metadata files defined as of Windows Server 2003:

- \$AttrDef
- \$BadClus
- \$BadClus:\$Bad
- \$BitMap
- \$Boot
- \$LogFile
- \$Mft
- \$MftMirr
- \$Secure
- \$UpCase
- \$Volume
- \$Extend
- \$Extend\\\$Reparse
- \$Extend\\\$ObjId
- \$Extend\\\$UsnJrnl
- \$Extend\\\$UsnJrnl:\$Max
- \$Extend\\\$Quota

**Access is Denied.**  
RootkitRevealer should never report this discrepancy since it uses
mechanisms that allow it to access any file, directory, or registry key
on a system.

Visible in Windows API, directory index, but not in MFT.  
Visible in Windows API, but not in MFT or directory index.  
Visible in Windows API, MFT, but not in directory index.  
Visible in directory index, but not Windows API or MFT.

A file system scan consists of three components: the Windows API, the
NTFS Master File Table (MFT), and the NTFS on-disk directory index
structures. These discrepancies indicate that a file appears in only one
or two of the scans. A common reason is that a file is either created or
deleted during the scans. This is an example of RootkitRevealer's
discrepancy report for a file created during the scanning:

C:\\newfile.txt  
3/1/2005 5:26 PM  
8 bytes  
Visible in Windows API, but not in MFT or directory index.

**Windows API length not consistent with raw hive data.**  
Rootkits can attempt to hide themselves by misrepresenting the size of a
Registry value so that its contents aren't visible to the Windows API.
You should examine any such discrepancy, though it may also appear as a
result of Registry values that change during a scan.

**Type mismatch between Windows API and raw hive data.**  
Registry values have a type, such as DWORD and REG\_SZ, and this
discrepancy notes that the type of a value as reported through the
Windows API differs from that of the raw hive data. A rootkit can mask
its data by storing it as a REG\_BINARY value, for example, and making
the Windows API believe it to be a REG\_SZ value; if it stores a 0 at
the start of the data the Windows API will not be able to access
subsequent data.

**Key name contains embedded nulls.**  
The Windows API treats key names as null-terminated strings, whereas the
kernel treats them as counted strings. Thus, it is possible to create
Registry keys that are visible to the operating system, yet only
partially visible to Registry tools like Regedit. The
[Reghide](reghide.md) sample code
at Sysinternals demonstrates this technique, which is used by both
malware and rootkits to hide Registry data. Use the Sysinternals
[RegDelNull](regdelnull.md)
utility to delete keys with embedded nulls.

**Data mismatch between Windows API and raw hive data.**  
This discrepancy will occur if a Registry value is updated while the
Registry scan is in progress. Values that change frequently include
timestamps such as the Microsoft SQL Server uptime value, shown below,
and virus scanner "last scan" values. You should investigate any
reported value to ensure that it's a valid application or system Registry
value.

Server\\RECOVERYMANAGER\\MSSQLServer\\uptime\_time\_utc
