## Introduction

VMMap is a process virtual and physical memory analysis utility. It
shows a breakdown of a process's committed virtual memory types as well
as the amount of physical memory (working set) assigned by the operating
system to those types. Besides graphical representations of memory
usage, VMMap also shows summary information and a detailed process
memory map. Powerful filtering and refresh capabilities allow you to
identify the sources of process memory usage and the memory cost of
application features.

Besides flexible views for analyzing live processes, VMMap supports the
export of data in multiple forms, including a native format that
preserves all the information so that you can load back in. It also
includes command-line options that enable scripting scenarios.

VMMap is the ideal tool for developers wanting to understand and
optimize their application's memory resource usage.
