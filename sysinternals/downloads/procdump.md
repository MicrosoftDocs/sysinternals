## Introduction

ProcDump is a command-line utility whose primary purpose is monitoring
an application for CPU spikes and generating crash dumps during a spike
that an administrator or developer can use to determine the cause of the
spike. ProcDump also includes hung window monitoring (using the same
definition of a window hang that Windows and Task Manager use),
unhandled exception monitoring and can generate dumps based on the
values of system performance counters. It also can serve as a general
process dump utility that you can embed in other scripts.

## Using ProcDump

**Capture Usage:**

```cmd
procdump.exe [-mm] [-ma] [-mt] [-mp] [-mc <Mask>] [-md <Callback_DLL>] [-mk]
            [-n <Count>]
            [-s <Seconds>]
            [-c|-cl <CPU_Usage> [-u]]
            [-m|-ml <Commit_Usage>]
            [-p|-pl <Counter> <Threshold>]
            [-h]
            [-e [1] [-g] [-b] [-ld] [-ud] [-ct] [-et]]
            [-l]
            [-t]
            [-f  <Include_Filter>, ...]
            [-fx <Exclude_Filter>, ...]
            [-dc <Comment>]
            [-o]
            [-r [1..5] [-a]]
            [-at <Timeout>]
            [-wer]
            [-64]
            {
                {{[-w] <Process_Name> | <Service_Name> | <PID>} [<Dump_File> | <Dump_Folder>]}
            |
                {-x <Dump_Folder> <Image_File> [Argument, ...]}
            }
```

**Install Usage:**

```cmd
procdump.exe -i [Dump_Folder]
            [-mm] [-ma] [-mt] [-mp] [-mc <Mask>] [-md <Callback_DLL>] [-mk]
            [-r]
            [-at <Timeout>]
            [-k]
            [-wer]
```

**Uninstall Usage:**

```cmd
procdump.exe -u
```

**Dump Types:**

| Dump Type | Description |  
|-----------|-------------|  
| **-mm** | Write a 'Mini' dump file. (default)<br />- Includes directly and indirectly referenced memory (stacks and what they reference).<br />- Includes all metadata (Process, Thread, Module, Handle, Address Space, etc.). |
| **-ma** | Write a 'Full' dump file.<br />- Includes all memory (Image, Mapped and Private).<br />- Includes all metadata (Process, Thread, Module, Handle, Address Space, etc.). |
| **-mt** | Write a 'Triage' dump file.<br />- Includes directly referenced memory (stacks).<br />- Includes limited metadata (Process, Thread, Module and Handle).<br />- Removal of sensitive information is attempted but not guaranteed. |
| **-mp** | Write a 'MiniPlus' dump file.<br />- Includes all Private memory and all Read/Write Image or Mapped memory.<br />- Includes all metadata (Process, Thread, Module, Handle, Address Space, etc.).<br />- To minimize size, the largest Private memory area over 512MB is excluded.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A memory area is defined as the sum of same-sized memory allocations.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The dump is as detailed as a Full dump but 10%-75% the size.<br />- Note: CLR processes are dumped as Full (-ma) due to debugging limitations. |
| **-mc** | Write a 'Custom' dump file.<br />- Includes the memory and metadata defined by the specified `MINIDUMP_TYPE` mask (Hex). |
| **-md** | Write a 'Callback' dump file.<br />- Includes the memory defined by the `MiniDumpWriteDump` callback routine named `MiniDumpCallbackRoutine` of the specified DLL.<br />- Includes all metadata (Process, Thread, Module, Handle, Address  Space, etc.). |
| **-mk** | Also write a 'Kernel' dump file.<br />- Includes the kernel stacks of the threads in the process.<br />- OS doesn't support a kernel dump (`-mk`) when using a clone (`-r`).<br />- When using multiple dump sizes, a kernel dump is taken for  each dump size. |

**Conditions:**

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **-a**   | Avoid outage. Requires `-r`. If the trigger will cause the target to suspend for a prolonged time due to an exceeded concurrent dump limit, the trigger will be skipped. |
| **-at**  | Avoid outage at Timeout. Cancel the trigger's collection at `N` seconds. |
| **-b**   | Treat debug breakpoints as exceptions (otherwise ignore them). |
| **-c**   | CPU threshold above which to create a dump of the process. |
| **-cl**  | CPU threshold below which to create a dump of the process. |
| **-dc**  | Add the specified string to the generated Dump Comment. |
| **-e**   | Write a dump when the process encounters an unhandled exception.<br />Include the `1` to create dump on first chance exceptions.<br />Add `-ld` to create a dump when a DLL (module) is loaded (filtering applies).<br />Add `-ud` to create a dump when a DLL (module) is unloaded (filtering applies).<br />Add `-ct` to create a dump when a thread is created.<br />Add `-et` to create a dump when a thread exits. |
| **-f**   | Filter (include) on the content of exceptions, debug logging and filename at DLL load/unload. Wildcards (\*) are supported. |
| **-fx**  | Filter (exclude) on the content of exceptions, debug logging and filename at DLL load/unload. Wildcards (\*) are supported. |
| **-g**   | Run as a native debugger in a managed process (no interop). |
| **-h**   | Write dump if process has a hung window (does not respond to window messages for at least 5 seconds). |
| **-k**   | Kill the process after cloning (`-r`), or at end of dump collection. |
| **-l**   | Display the debug logging of the process. |
| **-m**   | Memory commit threshold in MB at which to create a dump. |
| **-ml**  | Trigger when memory commit drops below specified MB value. |
| **-n**   | Number of dumps to write before exiting. |
| **-o**   | Overwrite an existing dump file. |
| **-p**   | Trigger when the Performance Counter is at, or exceeds, the specified Threshold. Some Counters and/or Instance Names can be case-sensitive. |
| **-pl**  | Trigger when the Performance Counter falls below the specified Threshold. |
| **-r**   | Dump using a clone. Concurrent limit is optional (default 1, max 5). OS doesn't support a kernel dump (`-mk`) when using a clone (`-r`). **CAUTION:** a high concurrency value may impact system performance.<br />- Windows 7: Uses Reflection. OS doesn't support `-e`.<br />- Windows 8.0: Uses Reflection. OS doesn't support `-e`.<br />- Windows 8.1+: Uses PSS. All trigger types are supported. |
| **-s**   | Consecutive seconds before dump is written (default is 10). |
| **-t**   | Write a dump when the process terminates. |
| **-u**   | Treat CPU usage relative to a single core (used with `-c`). |
| **-v**   | **DEBUG ONLY:** Verbose output. |
| **-w**   | Wait for the specified process to launch if it's not running. |
| **-wer** | Queue the (largest) dump to Windows Error Reporting. |
| **-x**   | Launch the specified image with optional arguments. If it is a Store Application or Package, ProcDump will start on the next activation (only). |
| **-y**   | **HIDDEN:** Store Application activation. |
| **-64**  | By default ProcDump will capture a 32-bit dump of a 32-bit process when running on 64-bit Windows. This option overrides to create a 64-bit dump. Only use for WOW64 subsystem debugging. |

**License Agreement:**

Use the `-accepteula` command line option to automatically accept the
Sysinternals license agreement.

**Automated Termination:**

`-cancel <Target Process PID>`

Using this option or setting an event with the name `ProcDump-<PID>` is the same as typing Ctrl+C to gracefully terminate ProcDump. Graceful termination ensures the process is resumed if a capture is active. The cancellation applies to ALL ProcDump instances monitoring the process.

**Filename:**

Default dump filename: `PROCESSNAME_YYMMDD_HHMMSS.dmp`

The following substitutions are supported:

| Substitution  | Explanation        |
| ------------- | -----------------  |
| PROCESSNAME   | Process Name       |
| PID           | Process ID         |
| EXCEPTIONCODE | Exception Code     |
| YYMMDD        | Year/Month/Day     |
| HHMMSS        | Hour/Minute/Second |

## Examples

- Write a mini dump of a process named 'notepad' (only one match can
exist):

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump notepad
  ```

- Write a Full dump of a process with PID '4572':

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump -ma 4572
  ```

- Write a Mini first, and then a Full dump of a process with PID '4572':

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump -mm -ma 4572
  ```

- Write 3 Mini dumps 5 seconds apart of a process named 'notepad':

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump -n 3 -s 5 notepad
  ```

- Write up to 3 Mini dumps of a process named 'consume' when it exceeds
  20% CPU usage for five seconds:

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump -n 3 -s 5 -c 20 consume
  ```

- Write a Mini dump for a process named 'hang.exe' when one of its
  windows is unresponsive for more than 5 seconds:

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump -h hang.exe
  ```

- Write a Full and Kernel dump for a process named 'hang.exe' when one of its
  windows is unresponsive for more than 5 seconds:

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump -ma -mk -h hang.exe
  ```

- Write a Mini dump of a process named 'outlook' when total system CPU
  usage exceeds 20% for 10 seconds:

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump outlook -s 10 -p "\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time" 20
  ```

- Write a Full dump of a process named 'outlook' when Outlook's handle
  count exceeds 10,000:

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump -ma outlook -p "\Process(Outlook)\Handle Count" 10000
  ```

- Write a Full dump of 'svchost' PID 1234, Instance #87, when the handle count
  exceeds 10,000:

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump -ma 1234 -p "\Process(svchost#87)\Handle Count" 10000
  ```

  **Note: Multiple Instance Counters**  
  If there are multiple instances of the counter, you'll need to
  include the Name and/or Instance number.

  ```txt
  \Processor(NNN)\% Processor Time
  \Thermal Zone Information(<name>)\Temperature
  \Process(<name>[#NNN])\<counter>
  ```

  Older OSes require you to append the PID for `\Process` counters.

  ```txt
  \Process(<name>[_PID])\<counter>
  ```

  **Tip:** Use Performance Monitor to view the counters (esp. case sensitivity).  
  **Tip:** For `\Process(*)` based counters, use PowerShell to map a PID to its `#NNN`.

  ```pwsh
  Get-Counter -Counter "\Process(*)\ID Process"
  ```

- Write a Full dump for a 2nd chance exception:

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump -ma -e w3wp.exe
  ```

- Write a Full dump for a 1st or 2nd chance exception:

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump -ma -e 1 w3wp.exe
  ```

- Write a Full dump for a debug string message:

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump -ma -l w3wp.exe
  ```

- Write up to 10 Full dumps of each 1st or 2nd chance exception of w3wp.exe:

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump -ma -n 10 -e 1 w3wp.exe
  ```

- Write up to 10 Full dumps if an exception's code/name/msg contains '`NotFound`':

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump -ma -n 10 -e 1 -f NotFound w3wp.exe
  ```

- Write up to 10 Full dumps if a debug string message contains '`NotFound`':

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump -ma -n 10 -l -f NotFound w3wp.exe
  ```

- Wait for a process called 'notepad' (and monitor it for exceptions):

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump -e -w notepad
  ```

- Launch a process called 'notepad' (and monitor it for exceptions):

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump -e -x c:\dumps notepad
  ```

- Register for launch, and attempt to activate, a store 'application'. A new ProcDump instance will start when it is activated:

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump -e -x c:\dumps Microsoft.BingMaps_8wekyb3d8bbwe!AppexMaps
  ```

- Register for launch of a store 'package'. A new ProcDump instance will start when it is (manually) activated:

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump -e -x c:\dumps Microsoft.BingMaps_1.2.0.136_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe
  ```

- Write a MiniPlus dump of the Microsoft Exchange Information Store when it has an unhandled exception:

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump -mp -e store.exe
  ```

- Display without writing a dump, the exception codes/names of w3wp.exe:

  ```cmd
  C:\>procdump -e 1 -f "" w3wp.exe
  ```

  ```

  ..or..

  ```cmd
  C:\Dumps>procdump -ma -i
  ```
