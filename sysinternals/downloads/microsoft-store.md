## Sysinternals Suite

Version 2023.11.1  
November 13, 2023

Sysinternals Suite is installed as an [MSIX bundle](/windows/msix/package/bundling-overview) from the Microsoft Store.

### Usage

Like most other MSIX packages, Sysinternals Suite is installed per user, but the binaries are stored in a secure location and shared by users. Graphical tools, like Process Explorer, are added to the Windows Start menu. Starting with Windows 11, they are grouped in a Sysinternals Suite folder ([VisualGroup property](/windows/msix/packaging-tool/create-start-group)).

> [!NOTE]
> Windows 10 does not support Start menu folders for MSIX packages so the tools are not grouped in a Sysinternals Suite folder.

All executables are available from the path via Windows [app execution aliases](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-uap5-appexecutionalias):

### App Execution Aliases

- To view all, search for "Manage app execution aliases" from Windows Search or Settings.
- They are a special type of reparse point managed by Windows for MSIX packages.
- They are stored in a directory in the user profile, which is in the path:
  - **%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps**
- The full list for Sysinternals Suite is in the following directory:
  - **%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps\Microsoft.SysinternalsSuite_8wekyb3d8bbwe**
  - Looking here is a way to list all app execution aliases from the package.
- They are deleted when the MSIX package is uninstalled.

### Processor Architecture

- The MSIX bundle contains separate packages for ARM64, x64, and x86.
- Only the package matching the OS is downloaded and installed.
- Packaged executables do not have a suffix ('64' for x64, '64a' for ARM64).
  - For example, procexp.exe on x64 is the same as the unpackaged procexp64.exe.
