## Introduction

*PsInfo* is a command-line tool that gathers key information about the
local or remote Windows NT/2000 system, including the type of
installation, kernel build, registered organization and owner, number of
processors and their type, amount of physical memory, the install date
of the system, and if it's a trial version, the expiration date.  

## Installation

Just copy *PsInfo* onto your executable path, and type "psinfo".  

## Using PsInfo

By default *PsInfo* shows information for the local system. Specify a
remote computer name to obtain information from the remote system. Since
*PsInfo* relies on remote Registry access to obtain its data, the remote
system must be running the Remote Registry service and the account from
which you run *PsInfo* must have access to the HKLM\\System portion of
the remote Registry.

In order to aid in automated Service Pack updates, *PsInfo* returns as a
value the Service Pack number of system (e.g. 0 for no service pack, 1
for SP 1, etc).

## How it Works

*PsInfo* uses the Remote Registry API to read system information from a
system's Registry, and WMI to determine whether Windows XP installations
have been activated.
