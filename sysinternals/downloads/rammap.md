Have you ever wondered exactly how Windows is assigning physical memory,
how much file data is cached in RAM, or how much RAM is used by the
kernel and device drivers? RAMMap makes answering those questions easy.
RAMMap is an advanced physical memory usage analysis utility for Windows
Vista and higher. It presents usage information in different ways on its
several different tabs:

-   *Use Counts:* usage summary by type and paging list
-   *Processes:* process working set sizes
-   *Priority Summary:* prioritized standby list sizes
-   *Physical Pages:* per-page use for all physical memory
-   *Physical Ranges:* physical memory addresses
-   *File Summary:* file data in RAM by file
-   *File Details:* individual physical pages by file

Use RAMMap to gain understanding of the way Windows manages memory, to
analyze application memory usage, or to answer specific questions about
how RAM is being allocated. RAMMap’s refresh feature enables you to
update the display and it includes support for saving and loading memory
snapshots.

For definitions of the labels RAMMap uses as well as to learn about the
physical-memory allocation algorithms used by the Windows memory
manager, please see [Windows Internals, 5^th^
Edition](~/learn/windows-internals.md).
