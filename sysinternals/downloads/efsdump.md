## Introduction

Windows 2000 introduces the Encrypting File System (EFS) so that users
can protect their sensitive data. Several new APIs make their debut to
support this facility, including one-QueryUsersOnEncryptedFile-that
lets you see who has access to encrypted files. This applet uses the API
to show you what accounts are authorized to access encrypted files.
