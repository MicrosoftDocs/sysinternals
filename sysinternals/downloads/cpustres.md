## Introduction

**Cpustres**  
Cpustres is a utility that can be used to simulate CPU activity by running 
up to 64 threads in a tight loop.

Each thread can be started, paused or stopped independently and can be configured with the following parameters:

- **Activity Level**  This can be Low, Medium, Busy or Maximum which controls how long the thread sleepss between cycles. Setting this value to Maximum causes the thread to run continuously.
- **Priority**  This controls the thread priority. Refer to Windows Internals by Mark Russinovich for details on thread priorities




**Runs on:**

-   Client: Windows Vista and higher
-   Server: Windows Server 2003 and higher
-   Nano Server: 2016 and higher
