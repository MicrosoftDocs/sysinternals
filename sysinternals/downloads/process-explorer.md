## Introduction

Ever wondered which program has a particular file or directory open? Now
you can find out. *Process Explorer* shows you information about which
handles and DLLs processes have opened or loaded.

The *Process Explorer* display consists of two sub-windows. The top
window always shows a list of the currently active processes, including
the names of their owning accounts, whereas the information displayed in
the bottom window depends on the mode that *Process Explorer* is in: if
it is in handle mode you'll see the handles that the process selected in
the top window has opened; if *Process Explorer* is in DLL mode you'll
see the DLLs and memory-mapped files that the process has loaded.
*Process Explorer* also has a powerful search capability that will
quickly show you which processes have particular handles opened or DLLs
loaded.

The unique capabilities of *Process Explorer* make it useful for
tracking down DLL-version problems or handle leaks, and provide insight
into the way Windows and applications work.

## Note on use of symbols:
When you configure the path to DBGHELP.DLL and the symbol path uses the symbol server, the location of DBGHELP.DLL also has to contain the SYMSRV.DLL supporting the server paths used. See [SymSrv documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/symsrv) or more information on how to use symbol servers.
