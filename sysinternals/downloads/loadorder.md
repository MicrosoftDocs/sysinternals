## Introduction

This applet shows you the order that a Windows NT or Windows 2000 system
loads device drivers. Note that on Windows 2000 plug-and-play drivers
may actually load in a different order than the one calculated, because
plug-and-play drivers are loaded on demand during device detection and
enumeration.
