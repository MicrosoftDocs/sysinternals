## Introduction

The Resource Kit comes with a utility, elogdump, that lets you dump the
contents of an Event Log on the local or a remote computer. *PsLogList*
is a clone of elogdump except that *PsLogList* lets you login to remote
systems in situations your current set of security credentials would not
permit access to the Event Log, and *PsLogList* retrieves message
strings from the computer on which the event log you view resides.  

## Installation

Just copy *PsLogList* onto your executable path, and type "psloglist".  

## Using PsLogList

The default behavior of *PsLogList* is to show the contents of the
System Event Log on the local computer, with visually-friendly
formatting of Event Log records. Command line options let you view logs
on different computers, use a different account to view a log, or to
have the output formatted in a string-search friendly way.

|      **eventlog**      |                                                                          eventlog                                                                          |

## How it Works

Like Win NT/2K's built-in Event Viewer and the Resource Kit's elogdump,
*PsLogList* uses the Event Log API, which is documented in Windows
Platform SDK. *PsLogList* loads message source modules on the system
where the event log being viewed resides so that it correctly displays
event log messages.
