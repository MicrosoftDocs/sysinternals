## Introduction

Working on NT and Win2K means that executables and object files will
many times have embedded UNICODE strings that you cannot easily see with
a standard ASCII strings or grep programs. So we decided to roll our
own. Strings just scans the file you pass it for UNICODE (or ASCII)
strings of a default length of 3 or more UNICODE (or ASCII) characters.
Note that it works under Windows 95 as well.

 

## Using Strings

**usage: strings \[-a\] \[-f offset\] \[-b bytes\] \[-n length\] \[-o\]
\[-q\] \[-s\] \[-u\] &lt;file or directory&gt;**

Strings takes wild-card expressions for file names, and additional
command line parameters are defined as follows:

|Parameter  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|  **-a**  | Ascii-only search (Unicode and Ascii is default) |
|  **-b**  | Bytes of file to scan |
|  **-f**  | File offset at which to start scanning. |
|  **-o**  | Print offset in file string was located |
|  **-n**  | Minimum string length (default is 3) |
|  **-s**  | Recurse subdirectories |
|  **-u**  | Unicode-only search (Unicode and Ascii is default) | 
|  **-nobanner**  | Do not display the startup banner and copyright message. |

To search one or more files for the presence of a particular string
using strings use a command like this:

**strings \* | findstr /i TextToSearchFor**
