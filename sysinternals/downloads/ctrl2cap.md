## Introduction

Ctrl2Cap is a tool to help remap the Caps Lock key to Ctrl.
People like myself that migrated to NT from UNIX are
used to having the control key located where the caps-lock key is on the
standard PC keyboard, so a utility like this is essential for our
editing well-being.

## Installation and Use

Install Ctrl2Cap running the command `ctrl2cap /install` from the
directory into which you've unzipped the Ctrl2Cap files. To uninstall
type `ctrl2cap /uninstall`.
