# Sysinternals Miscellaneous Utilities

[AD Explorer](adexplorer.md)  
Active Directory Explorer is an advanced Active Directory (AD) viewer
and editor.

[AdRestore](adrestore.md)  
Restore tombstoned Active Directory objects in Server 2003 domains.

[Autologon](autologon.md)  
Bypass password screen during logon.

[BgInfo](bginfo.md)  
This fully-configurable program automatically generates desktop
backgrounds that include important information about the system
including IP addresses, computer name, network adapters, and more.

[BlueScreen](bluescreen.md)  
This screen saver not only accurately simulates Blue Screens, but
simulated reboots as well (complete with CHKDSK), and works on Windows
Vista, Server 2008 and higher.

[Ctrl2cap](ctrl2cap.md)  
This is a kernel-mode driver that demonstrates keyboard input filtering
just above the keyboard class driver in order to turn caps-locks into
control keys. Filtering at this level allows conversion and hiding of
keys before NT even "sees" them. Ctrl2cap also shows how to use
NtDisplayString() to print messages to the initialization blue-screen.

[DebugView](debugview.md)  
Another first from Sysinternals: This program intercepts calls made to
DbgPrint by device drivers and OutputDebugString made by Win32 programs.
It allows for viewing and recording of debug session output on your
local machine or across the Internet without an active debugger.

[Desktops](desktops.md)  
This new utility enables you to create up to four virtual desktops and
to use a tray interface or hotkeys to preview whatâ€™s on each desktop and
easily switch between them.

[Hex2dec](hex2dec.md)  
Convert hex numbers to decimal and vice versa.

[NotMyFault](notmyfault.md)  
Notmyfault is a tool that you can use to crash, hang, and cause kernel
memory leaks on your Windows system.

[PsLogList](psloglist.md)  
Dump event log records.

[PsTools](pstools.md)  
The PsTools suite includes command-line utilities for listing the
processes running on local or remote computers, running processes
remotely, rebooting computers, dumping event logs, and more.

[RegDelNull](regdelnull.md)  
Scan for and delete Registry keys that contain embedded null-characters
that are otherwise undeleteable by standard Registry-editing tools.

[Registry Usage (RU)](ru.md)  
View the registry space usage for the specified registry key.

[RegJump](regjump.md)  
Jump to the registry path you specify in Regedit.

[Strings](strings.md)  
Search for ANSI and UNICODE strings in binary images.

[ZoomIt](zoomit.md)  
Presentation utility for zooming and drawing on the screen.
