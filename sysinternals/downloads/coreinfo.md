## Introduction

Coreinfo is a command-line utility that shows you the mapping between logical processors and the physical processor, NUMA node, and socket on which they reside, as well as the cache’s assigned to each logical processor. It uses the Windows’ [GetLogicalProcessorInformation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms683194.aspx) function to obtain this information and prints it to the screen, representing a mapping to a logical processor with an asterisk e.g. ‘*’. Coreinfo is useful for gaining insight into the processor and cache topology of your system.

## Installation

You run Coreinfo by typing "coreinfo”.

## Using CoreInfo

For each resource it shows a map of the OS-visible processors
that correspond to the specified resources, with '*' representing the
applicable processors. For example, on a 4-core system, a line in the
cache output with a map of shared by cores 3 and 4.

**Usage: coreinfo [-c][-f][-g][-l][-n][-s][-m][-v]**

|Parameter  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
| **-c** | Dump information on cores. |
| **-f** | Dump core feature information. |
| **-g** | Dump information on groups. |
| **-l** | Dump information on caches. |
| **-n** | Dump information on NUMA nodes. |
| **-s** | Dump information on sockets. |
| **-m** | Dump NUMA access cost. |
| **-v** | Dump only virtualization-related features including support for second level address translation.
(requires administrative rights on Intel systems). |

All options except -v are selected by default.

**Coreinfo Output:**
