## Introduction

*DebugView* is an application that lets you monitor debug output on your
local system, or any computer on the network that you can reach via
TCP/IP. It is capable of displaying both kernel-mode and Win32 debug
output, so you don't need a debugger to catch the debug output your
applications or device drivers generate, nor do you need to modify your
applications or drivers to use non-standard debug output APIs.  
  

## DebugView Capture

Under Windows 2000, XP, Server 2003 and Vista *DebugView* will capture:

-   Win32 **OutputDebugString**
-   Kernel-mode **DbgPrint**
-   All kernel-mode variants of **DbgPrint** implemented in Windows XP
    and Server 2003

*DebugView* also extracts kernel-mode debug output generated before a
crash from Window's 2000/XP crash dump files if *DebugView* was
capturing at the time of the crash.  
  

## DebugView Capabilites

*DebugView* has a powerful array of features for controlling and
managing debug output.

Features new to version 4.6:

-   **Support for Windows Vista 32-bit and 64-bit**

Features new to version 4.5:

-   **Support for log-file rollover:** To better support long-running
    captures, DebugView can now create a new log file each day,
    optionally clearing the display when doing so.

Features new to version 4.4:

- <strong>Support for Windows Server 2003 64-bit Edition and Windows XP
  64-bit Edition for x64:</strong>*DebugView* now captures kernel-mode debug
  output on 64-bit versions of Windows.
- **Clock-time toggle:** you can now toggle between clock time and
  elapsed time modes.

Features new to version 4.3:

- **Support for Windows XP SP2:**<em>DebugView</em> now captures kernel-mode
  debug output on Windows XP SP2.
- **More highlighting filters:** Many people have asked for more
  highlighting filters.
- **Log file wrapping:** A new log file option has *DebugView* wrap
  around to the start of the log file when the specified size limit is
  reached.
- **Larger buffers:** Larger Win32 and kernel-mode buffers lessen the
  chance of dropped debug output.
- **Clear-output string:** When *DebugView* sees the special debug
  output string "DBGVIEWCLEAR" it clears the output.
- **Client minimize-to-tray:** You can now run the client minimized in
  the tray.

Features new to version 4.2:

- **Kernel-hook bug fixed:**<em>DebugView</em> sometimes mistakenly report
  that it couldn't hook kernel-mode debug output on Windows XP and
  Server 2003.
- **Client global-capture option:** A new option allows the client to
  capture console Win32 debug output on Terminal Server systems when
  run from a non-console session.
- **Filtering improved:** Filters can be much longer and now apply to
  Win32 process IDs when process IDs are included in the output.
- **Crash-dump support improved:** Several bugs related to extracting
  kernel-mode output from crash dumps are fixed and *DebugView* now
  loads resulting log files.
- **More highlight filters:**<em>DebugView</em> now has 10 highlight filters,
  up from 5.
- **Insert comments:** A new menu item lets you insert comments into
  output.
- **New switches:** New command-line switches allow you to specify
  history depth and load log files.
- **Better balloon tips:** If an output line is wider than the screen
  its mouse hover balloon tip word wraps.

Features new to version 4.1:

-   **Save and load filters:** You can save and load filters, including
    the highlighting colors.
-   **Load saved logs:** You can now load a log file back into the
    *DebugView* output window.
-   **Capture boot-time kernel-mode debug output:** Under Windows 2000,
    you can use *DebugView* to capture debug output generated by drivers
    from the earliest point in the boot process.

Here is a list highlighting some of *DebugView*'s other features:

- **Remote monitoring:** Capture kernel-mode and/or Win32 debug output
  from any computer accessible via TCP/IP - even across the Internet.
  You can monitor multiple remote computers simultaneously.
  *DebugView* will even install its client software itself if you are
  running it on a Windows 2000 system and are capturing from another
  Windows 2000 system in the same Network Neighborhood.
- **Most-recent-filter lists:**<em>DebugView</em> remembers your most recent
  filter selections, with an interface that makes it easy to reselect
  them.
- **Process ID option:** Toggle the display of process IDs for Win32
  debug output.
- **Clipboard copy:** Select multiple lines in the output window and
  copy their contents to the clipboard.
- **Log-to-file:** Write debug output to a file as its being captured.
- **Printing:** Print all or part of captured debug output to a
  printer.
- **One-file payload:**<em>DebugView</em> is implemented as one file.
- **Crash-Dump Support:**<em>DebugView</em> can recover its buffers from a
  crash dump and save the output to a log file so that users can send
  you the output your Windows driver generated right up to the time of
  a crash.

The on-line help file describes all these features, and more, in
detail.  
  

## Installation and Use

Simply execute the *DebugView* program file (dbgview.exe) and
*DebugView* will immediately start capturing debug output. Note that if
you run *DebugView* on Windows 2000/XP you must have administrative
privilege to view kernel-mode debug output. Menus, hot-keys, or toolbar
buttons can be used to clear the window, save the monitored data to a
file, search output, change the window font, and more. The on-line help
describes all of *DebugView*'s features.
