Sysinternals Process Utilities
==============================

[Autoruns](autoruns.md)  
See what programs are configured to startup automatically when your
system boots and you login. Autoruns also shows you the full list of
Registry and file locations where applications can configure auto-start
settings.

[Handle](handle.md)  
This handy command-line utility will show you what files are open by
which processes, and much more.

[ListDLLs](listdlls.md)  
List all the DLLs that are currently loaded, including where they are
loaded and their version numbers. Version 2.0 prints the full path names
of loaded modules.

[PortMon](portmon.md)  
Monitor serial and parallel port activity with this advanced monitoring
tool. It knows about all standard serial and parallel IOCTLs and even
shows you a portion of the data being sent and received. Version 3.x has
powerful new UI enhancements and advanced filtering capabilities.

[ProcDump](procdump.md)  
This new command-line utility is aimed at capturing process dumps of
otherwise difficult to isolate and reproduce CPU spikes. It also serves
as a general process dump creation utility and can also monitor and
generate process dumps when a process has a hung window or unhandled
exception.

[Process Explorer](process-explorer.md)  
Find out what files, registry keys and other objects processes have
open, which DLLs they have loaded, and more. This uniquely powerful
utility will even show you who owns each process.

[Process Monitor](procmon.md)  
Monitor file system, Registry, process, thread and DLL activity in
real-time.

[PsExec](psexec.md)  
Execute processes remotely.

[PsGetSid](psgetsid.md)  
Displays the SID of a computer or a user.

[PsKill](pskill.md)  
Terminate local or remote processes.

[PsList](pslist.md)  
Show information about processes and threads.

[PsService](psservice.md)  
View and control services.

[PsSuspend](pssuspend.md)  
Suspend and resume processes.

[PsTools](pstools.md)  
The PsTools suite includes command-line utilities for listing the
processes running on local or remote computers, running processes
remotely, rebooting computers, dumping event logs, and more.

[ShellRunas](shellrunas.md)  
Launch programs as a different user via a convenient shell context-menu
entry.

[VMMap](vmmap.md)  
See a breakdown of a process's committed virtual memory types as well as
the amount of physical memory (working set) assigned by the operating
system to those types. Identify the sources of process memory usage and
the memory cost of application features.
