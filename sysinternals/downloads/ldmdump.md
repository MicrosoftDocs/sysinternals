## Introduction

Windows 2000 introduces a new type of disk partitioning scheme that is
managed by a component called the Logical Disk Manager (LDM). Basic
disks implement standard DOS-style partition tables, whereas Dynamic
disks use LDM partitioning. LDM partitioning offers several advantages
over DOS partitioning including replication across disks, on-disk storage
of advanced volume configuration (spanned volume, mirrored volumes,
striped volumes and RAID-5 volumes). My March/April two-part series on
Windows NT/2000 storage management in *Windows 2000 Magazine* describes
the details of each partitioning scheme.

Other than the Disk Management MMC-snapin and a tool called dmdiag in
the Windows 2000 Resource Kit, there are no tools for investigating the
internals of the LDM on-disk database that describes a system's
partitioning layout. *LDMDump* is a utility that lets you examine
exactly what is stored in a disk's copy of the system LDM database.
*LDMDump* shows you the contents of the LDM database private header,
table-of-contents, and object database (where partition, component and
volume definitions are stored), and then summarizes its finding with
partition table and volume listings.  

## Installing and Using LDMDump

To use *LDMDump* simply pass it the identifier of a disk.

**Usage: ldmdump \[- \] \[-d\#\]**

|Parameter  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|  **-**  |    Displays the supported options and the units of measurement used for output values.|
|  **-d\#** |  Specifies the number of the disk for *LDMDump* to examine. For example, "ldmdump /d0" has *LDMDump* show the LDM database information stored on disk 0.|

## How it Works

There are no published APIs available for obtaining detailed
information about a disk's LDM partitioning, and the LDM database format
is completely undocumented. *LDMDump* was developed based on study of
LDM database contents on a variety of different systems and under
changing conditions.
