## Introduction

ListDLLs is a utility that reports the DLLs loaded into processes. You
can use it to list all DLLs loaded into all processes, into a specific
process, or to list the processes that have a particular DLL loaded.
ListDLLs can also display full version information for DLLs, including
their digital signature, and can be used to scan processes for unsigned
DLLs.

## Usage

**listdlls \[-r\] \[-v | -u\] \[processname|pid\]  
listdlls \[-r\] \[-v\] \[-d dllname\]**

 
|Parameter  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|  **processname**  | Dump DLLs loaded by process (partial name accepted).|
|  **pid**          | Dump DLLs associated with the specified process id.|
|  **dllname**      | Show only processes that have loaded the specified DLL.|
|  **-r**           | Flag DLLs that relocated because they are not loaded at their base address.|
|  **-u**           | Only list unsigned DLLs.|
|  **-v**           | Show DLL version information.|

## Examples

List the DLLs loaded into Outlook.exe, including their version
information:

**listdlls -v outlook**

List any unsigned DLLs loaded into any process:

**listdlls -u**
