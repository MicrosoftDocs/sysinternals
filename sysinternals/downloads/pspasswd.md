## Introduction

Systems administrators that manage local administrative accounts on
multiple computers regularly need to change the account password as part
of standard security practices. *PsPasswd* is a tool that lets you
change an account password on the local or remote systems, enabling
administrators to create batch files that run *PsPasswd* against the
computers they manage in order to perform a mass change of the
administrator password.

PsPasswd uses Windows password reset APIs, so does not send passwords
over the network in the clear.



## Installation

Just copy *PsPasswd* onto your executable path, and type "pspasswd" with
the command-line syntax shown below..



## Using PsPasswd

You can use *PsPasswd* to change the password of a local or domain
account on the local or a remote computer.
