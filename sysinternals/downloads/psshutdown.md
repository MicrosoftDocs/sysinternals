## Introduction

*PsShutdown* is a command-line utility similar to the shutdown utility
from the Windows 2000 Resource Kit, but with the ability to do much
more. In addition to supporting the same options for shutting down or
rebooting the local or a remote computer, *PsShutdown* can logoff the
console user or lock the console (locking requires Windows 2000 or
higher). *PsShutdown* requires no manual installation of client
software.

## Installation

Just copy *PsShutdown* onto your executable path, and type psshutdown
with command-line options defined below.

## Using PsShutdown

See the February 2005 issue of Windows IT Pro Magazine for Mark's
article (https<nolink>://www.windowsitpro.com/article/articleid/44973/44973.html)
that covers advanced usage of *PsKill*.

You can use *PsShutdown* to initiate a shutdown of the local or a remote
computer, logoff a user, lock a system, or to abort an imminent
shutdown.
