## Introduction

Utilities like Telnet and remote control programs like Symantec's PC
Anywhere let you execute programs on remote systems, but they can be a
pain to set up and require that you install client software on the
remote systems that you wish to access. PsExec is a light-weight
telnet-replacement that lets you execute processes on other systems,
complete with full interactivity for console applications, without
having to manually install client software. PsExec's most powerful uses
include launching interactive command-prompts on remote systems and
remote-enabling tools like IpConfig that otherwise do not have the
ability to show information about remote systems.

Note: some anti-virus scanners report that one or more of the tools are
infected with a "remote admin" virus. None of the PsTools contain
viruses, but they have been used by viruses, which is why they trigger
virus notifications.

## Installation

Just copy PsExec onto your executable path. Typing "psexec" displays its
usage syntax.

## Using PsExec

See the July 2004 issue of *Windows IT Pro Magazine* for [Mark's
article](https://www.itprotoday.com/compute-engines/psexec) that covers
advanced usage of PsExec.

**Usage:**

```cmd
psexec [\\\\computer[,computer2[,...] | @file]][-u user [-p psswd]][-n s][-r servicename][-h][-l][-s|-e][-x][-i [session]][-c [-f|-v]][-w directory][-d][-<priority>][-g n][-a n,n,...][-accepteula][-nobanner] cmd [arguments]
```

You can enclose applications that have spaces in their name with
quotation marks e.g.

```cmd
psexec \\marklap "c:\\long name app.exe"
```

Input is only passed to the remote system when you press the Enter key.
Typing Ctrl-C terminates the remote process.

If you omit a user name, the process will run in the context of your
account on the remote system, but will not have access to network
resources (because it is impersonating). Specify a valid user name in
the `Domain\User` syntax if the remote process requires access to network
resources or to run in a different account. Note that the password and
command are encrypted in transit to the remote system.

Error codes returned by PsExec are specific to the applications you
execute, not PsExec.

## Examples

This article I wrote [describes how PsExec
works](https://www.itprotoday.com/compute-engines/psexec) and gives tips
on how to use it:

The following command launches an interactive command prompt on
`\\marklap`:

```cmd
psexec -i \\marklap cmd
```

This command executes IpConfig on the remote system with the `/all`
switch, and displays the resulting output locally:

```cmd
psexec -i \\marklap ipconfig /all
```

This command copies the program `test.exe` to the remote system and
executes it interactively:

```cmd
psexec -i \\marklap -c test.exe
```

Specify the full path to a program that is already installed on a remote
system if its not on the system's path:

```cmd
psexec -i \\marklap c:\bin\test.exe
```

Run Regedit interactively in the System account to view the contents of
the SAM and SECURITY keys::

```cmd
psexec -i -d -s c:\windows\regedit.exe
```

To run Internet Explorer as with limited-user privileges use this
command:

```cmd
psexec -l -d "c:\program files\internet explorer\iexplore.exe"
```
