## Introduction

ADInsight is an LDAP (Light-weight Directory Access Protocol) real-time
monitoring tool aimed at troubleshooting Active Directory client
applications. Use its detailed tracing of Active Directory client-server
communications to solve Windows authentication, Exchange, DNS, and other
problems.

ADInsight uses DLL injection techniques to intercept calls that
applications make in the Wldap32.dll library, which is the standard
library underlying Active Directory APIs such ldap and ADSI. Unlike
network monitoring tools, ADInsight intercepts and interprets all
client-side APIs, including those that do not result in transmission to
a server. ADInsight monitors any process into which it can load itâ€™s
tracing DLL, which means that it does not require administrative
permissions, however, if run with administrative rights, it will also
monitor system processes, including windows services.
