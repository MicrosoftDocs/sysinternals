## Introduction

ZoomIt is a screen zoom, annotation, and recording tool for technical presentations
and demos. You can also use ZoomIt to snip screenshots to the clipboard or to a file.
ZoomIt runs unobtrusively in the tray and activates with customizable
hotkeys to zoom in on an area of the screen, move around while zoomed, and draw on
the zoomed image. I wrote ZoomIt to fit my specific needs and use it in all my
presentations.

ZoomIt works on all versions of Windows and you can use touch and pen input for
ZoomIt drawing on tablets.

## Using ZoomIt

The first time you run ZoomIt it presents a configuration dialog that
describes ZoomIt's behavior, let's you specify alternate hotkeys for
zooming and for entering drawing mode without zooming, and customize the
drawing pen color and size. I use the draw-without-zoom option to
annotate the screen at its native resolution, for example. ZoomIt also
includes a break timer feature that remains active even when you tab
away from the timer window and allows you to return to the timer window
by clicking on the ZoomIt tray icon.

### Shortcuts

ZoomIt offers a number of shortcuts which can extend its usage greatly.
