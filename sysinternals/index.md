## What's New [![RSS](/media/landing/sysinternals/rss.gif)](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/sysinternals/feed/) ##

### What's New (September 11, 2017) ###
  - [Sysmon v6.10](~/downloads/sysmon.md)  
    This update to Sysmon, a background monitor that records activity to the event log for use in security incident detection and forensics, adds monitoring of WMI filters and consumers, an autostart mechanism commonly used by malware, and fixes a bug in image load filtering. 

  - [Process Monitor v3.40](~/downloads/procmon.md)  
    Process Monitor, a file system registry, process and network real-time monitor, now includes a /runtime switch for terminating monitoring after a specified amount of time, when in hexadecimal mode shows process tree process IDs in hexadecimal, and fixes a bug in automated boot log conversion. 
    
  - [Autoruns v13.80](~/downloads/autoruns.md)  
    This release of Autoruns, a utility for viewing and managing autostart execution points (ASEPs), adds additional autostart entry points, has asynchronous file saving, fixes a bug parsing 32-bit paths on 64-bit Windows, shows the display name for drivers and services, and fixes a bug in offline Virus Total scanning. 

### What's New (May 16, 2017) ###
  - [ProcDump v9.0](~/downloads/procdump.md)  
    This major update to ProcDump, a utility that enables process dump capture based on a variety of triggers, introduces the ability to take capture multiple dumps sizes. This is particularly useful when capturing crash dumps of applications susceptible to termination due to unresponsiveness (e.g. IIS Ping killing w3wp.exe). This release also adds support for an associated Kernel Dump of the process that includes the kernel stacks of the process.</li>

### What's New (February 17, 2017) ###
  - [Sysmon v6](~/downloads/sysmon.md)  
    This release of Sysmon, a background monitor that records activity to the event log for use in security incident detection and forensics, introduces an option that displays event schema, adds an event for Sysmon configuration changes, interprets and displays registry paths in their common format, and adds named pipe create and connection events (thanks to Giulia Biagini for the contribution). Check out the related presentation from Mark’s RSA Conference, “[How to Go From Responding to Hunting with Sysinternals Sysmon](https://www.rsaconference.com/events/us17/agenda/sessions/7516-How-to-Go-from-Responding-to-Hunting-with-Sysinternals-Sysmon).”
  - [Autoruns v13.7](~/downloads/autoruns.md)  
    Autoruns, an autostart entry point management utility, now reports print providers, registrations in the WMI\Default namespace, fixes a KnownDLLs enumeration bug, and has improved toolbar usability on high-DPI displays.
  - [AccessChk v6.1](~/downloads/accesschk.md)  
    This update to AccessChk, a command-line utility that shows effective and actual permissions for file, registry, service, process object manager, and event logs, now reports Windows 10 process trust access control entries and token security attributes.

### What's New (November 28, 2016) ###
  - Announcing a new book, [Troubleshooting with the Windows Sysinternals Tools](~/learn/troubleshooting-book.md)
