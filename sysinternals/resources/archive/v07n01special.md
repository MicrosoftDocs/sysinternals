1. SYSINTERNALS RSS FEED

Due to popular demand, Sysinternals now has an RSS feed! I often update tools
on the site that don't merit a mention
on the home page, so if you want to keep up to date on these changes, follow
this new RSS feed. (And by the way, the
RSS reader that Dave Solomon and I use after evaluating several of the freeware
offerings is Sharpreader - get it
from www.sharpreader.net).

2. NEW AND UPDATED TOOLS

Several tools have been updated recently, including Process Explorer, Filemon,
Regmon, Autoruns, Handle, Sigcheck,
and Psshutdown. New tools since the last newsletter include: Rootkit Revealer
(finds hidden root kit viruses), Whois
(show web site ownership), and Du (disk usage).

3. MARK'S NEW BLOG

Like everyone else on the internet, I've started blogging! I'm actually
enjoying the opportunity to post informal notes
about various software and technology issues and reading responses from you, the
readers. To see my posts so far,

4. WINDOWS INTERNALS 4TH EDITION TO BE PART OF 2003 RESOURCE KIT!

Our new book Windows Internals 4th edition has been chosen to be part of the
soon to be released Windows Server
2003 Resource Kit (a 5 volume set). The book continues to be in the top 50

6. UPCOMING SYSINTERNALS/WINDOWS OS INTERNALS TRAINING

If you're an IT professional deploying and supporting Windows servers and
workstations, you need to be able to dig
beneath the surface when things go wrong. Having understanding of the internals
of the Windows operating system and
knowing how to use advanced troubleshooting tools will help you deal with such
problems and understand system
performance issues more effectively. Understanding the internals can help
programmers to better take advantage of the
Windows platform, as well as provide advanced debugging techniques. For a
really indepth look at the Windows kernel
internals and practical tips for using Sysinternals tools to troubleshoot your
Windows systems, come to one of our
public hands-on classes (bring your own laptop). Upcoming dates:
JUNE 6-10, Orlando, Flordia [5 day class]
JULY 4-8: Amsterdam, Netherlands [4 day class]
SEPTEMBER 19-23: San Francisco, California [5 day class]

You'll gain an in-depth understanding of the kernel architecture of Windows
NT/2000/XP/2003, including the internals of
processes, thread scheduling, memory management, I/O, services, security, the
registry, and the boot process. Also
covered are advanced troubleshooting techniques such as malware disinfection,
crash dump (blue screen) analysis,
and getting past boot problems. You'll also learn advanced tips on using the
key tools from www.sysinternals.com
(such as Filemon, Regmon, & Process Explorer) to troubleshoot a range of system
and application issues, such as
slow computers, virus detection, DLL conflicts, permission problems, and
registry issues. These tools are used on a
daily basis by Microsoft Product Support and have been used effectively to solve
a wide variety of desktop and server
issues, so being familiar with their operation and application will assist you
in dealing with different problems on
Windows. Real world examples will be given that show successful application of
these tools to solve real problems.
And because the course was developed with full access to the Windows kernel
source code AND developers, you
know you're getting the real story.
